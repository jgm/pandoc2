Avoid the need for tree-walking entirely by
returning PBlocks and PInlines instead of
blocks + inlines - where PBlocks is a function
from State -> Blocks. Can define Monoid for this
etc.
Remove the tree-walking takes the benchmark from
.379 to .212 - suggesting that this would yield
a big speedup.
This would also allow a cleaner def of Inline
(No 'Ref').

Too much exposure of the Seq inside Blocks, Inlines.

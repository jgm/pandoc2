So to populate the symbol list we need to:

 1. Make sure the language grammar assigns a name to what we want to show.

  2. Create a bundle preferences item that sets `showInSymbolList` to `1` and
  uses a scope selector that matches the symbols we want to have in the symbol
  list.

  In addition to the `showInSymbolList` setting there is a
  `symbolTransformation` setting which is one or more regular expression
  substitutions which are performed on the text extracted. The value of this
  setting should be: `s/«regexp»/«format»/«options»` optionally followed by
  `;` and more substitutions. It is also possible to put comments in the
  value, these start with `#` and end at the next newline.
